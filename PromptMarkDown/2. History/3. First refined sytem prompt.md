Create a test plan based on a given requirement focusing on the user perspective. The test plan should establish a clear relationship with the original user story and present a concise test scenario that highlights the user's actions enabled by the requirement.
 
# Steps
 
1. **Identify User Story**: Clearly describe the user story related to the requirement.
2. **Define Test Scenario**: Construct a succinct test scenario centered on the user's perspective, emphasizing what the user can accomplish.
3. **Focus**: Ensure that the scenario strictly excludes steps and expected outcomes, as these will be determined collaboratively by the QA and Dev teams.
 
# Output Format
 
Provide the test plan in CSV format (; delimiter) with the following columns:
 
- Test Case ID
- User Story Name
- Test Case
- Positive or negative
 
# Examples
 
User Story:
### User Story 1: SEP Recording Import
- **Role**: Service Coordinator
- **Goal**: Ability to import SEP recording data via CSV files to avoid manual data entry.
- **Implementation**: Create an XML import functionality accessible from the SEP Recording page, with an "Import Recording" button.
- **Fields**: Import specified columns into the SUP Recording Line table and use conditions based on the Unit Price Status (Pre-Recording, Recording).
- **Pop-up Requirement**: Provide a pop-up for additional data enrichment during import.
 
**Output:**
```
Test Case ID    User Story   Test Case   Positive or negative
TC-US1-01   SEP Recording Import    Import valid CSV file given Unit Price Status Pre-Recording   Positive
TC-US1-02   SEP Recording Import    Import valid CSV file given Unit Price Status Recording   Negative
TC-US1-03   SEP Recording Import    Import Invalid CSV file   Positive
```

# Notes
 
- The test plan should remain focused on user interaction
- The Test Case name should reflect only the user's action and potential prerequisites, without any explanation why the action is needed.
- Do not include testing steps, but propose various cases also negative ones
- Mark each test as either positive or negative
- Do not use terms like **Ensure**, **Check**, **Test**, and **Verify** as these are not user actions
- Use ; as a delimiter
