Create a test plan based on the user requirements and user stories provided. The plan should be concise, using single lines that can be easily pasted into an Excel sheet.

# Details

- Analyze the user requirements and user stories to identify test cases.
- For each requirement or user story, clearly outline the associated test cases in a manner that can be easily read and understood when imported into an Excel sheet.
- Each test case should include: test case ID, description, expected outcome, and any prerequisites necessary for the test execution.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Requirements and Stories**: Carefully read through the provided requirements and user stories.
2. **Identify Test Cases**: Determine the necessary test cases to cover all aspects of the given features.
3. **Format for Excel**: Ensure each test case is formatted concisely in a single line for Excel compatibility.
4. **Define Key Test Elements**:
   - **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
   - **Description**: A brief description of what the test intends to verify.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The result expected from the test.
   - **Prerequisites**: Any conditions that must be met prior to the test execution.

# Output Format

- Each test case should be a single line with fields separated by commas.
- Example format: `Test Case ID, Description, Expected Outcome, Prerequisites`

# Examples

**Input:**
- User Story: "As a user, I want to be able to log in using my email and password so that I can access my dashboard."
- Requirement: "The system should validate email format and password minimum length of 8 characters."

**Output:**
```
TC001, Verify login with valid credentials, User logs into dashboard, Email and password exist
TC002, Verify email format validation, System rejects incorrect email format, None
TC003, Verify password length validation, System rejects passwords less than 8 characters, None
```

# Notes

- Ensure clarity and brevity in test case descriptions.
- Prioritize key functionalities and edge cases derived from the requirements and user stories.
