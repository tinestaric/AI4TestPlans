## 🏁 Step 1 – Try on Your Own (Cold Prompt)
**🎯 Goal:** Prompt your first test plan using just the user story, no guidance. This helps establish a baseline and understand the model's default output with minimal direction.

**📝 Prompt Used:**
```
<write your original prompt here>
```
**(Remember to save the output from this prompt for comparison later!)**

**🧪 Outcome Notes:**
- Was the output relevant to the user story?
- What key information or test types were missing (e.g., positive tests, negative tests, boundary conditions)?
- How was the output structured? Was it easy to read and understand?
- Did the model include any specific edge cases or less obvious scenarios?
- Was the generated plan immediately actionable for a tester, or would it require significant refinement?
